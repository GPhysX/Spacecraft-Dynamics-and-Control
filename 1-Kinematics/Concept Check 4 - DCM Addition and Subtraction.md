# Question 1

Given the DCMs [QT] and [QR], how is [RT] computed?
- [ ] [RT] = [QR][QT]
- [ ] [RT] = [QT][QR]^T
- [x] [RT] = [QR]^T [QT]

# Question 2
If B is rotated 90 degrees about the first axis relative to N, and R is rotated -90 degrees about the second axis relative to N, what is the [BR] DCM?

- [ ] a
- [x] b
- [ ] c
