# Question 1
Find the differential kinematic equation of the (2-3-2) Euler angle set:
- [x] a
- [ ] b
- [ ] c
# Question 2
The initial (3-2-1) Euler angles yaw, pitch and roll of a vehicle are (\psi, \theta, \phi)(ψ,θ,ϕ) = (40, 30, 80) degrees. Assume the body angular velocity vector of the craft is given through the BB frame components as Bωω=⎡⎣sin(0.1t)0.01cos(0.1t)⎤⎦20deg/s. Write a program to numerically integrate the yaw, pitch and roll angles over a simulation time of 1 minute. Enter the Euler angle norm \sqrt{\psi^2 + \theta^2 + \phi^2} 
  at the simulation time step 42s. Express angles in radians.
