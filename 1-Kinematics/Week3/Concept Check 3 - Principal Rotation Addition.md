# Question 1
The BB frame is defined relative to NN frame as \Phi = 90Î¦=90 degrees with \hat{\bf e} = (1,0,0)^T What are the principal rotation parameters that map BB to NN?
- [ ] a
- [ ] b
- [ ] c
- [x] d
# Question 2
Given the (3-2-1) Euler angles (20,-10,120) degrees, what is the equivalent principal rotation parameters?
- [ ] a
- [x] b
- [ ] c
# Question 3
Two orientations are related through [FB] = [BN] = Sum these orientation to find [FN][FN] and express the answer using principal rotation parameters.
- [ ] a
- [ ] b
- [x] c
