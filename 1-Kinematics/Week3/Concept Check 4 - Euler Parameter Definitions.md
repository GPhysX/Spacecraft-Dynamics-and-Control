# Question 1
Is there only one notation for Euler parameters or quaternions?
- [ ] Yes, everyone is sensible and agreed on common notation.
- [x] No, attitude kinematics is a topic that spans many research fields, and the notations are varied.
- [ ] There is an international standards committee looking into this shortly.
# Question 2
How many coordinates do the Euler parameters use?
- [ ] 3
- [x] 4
- [ ] 5
# Question 3
How many constraints does the EP description have?
- [x] 1
- [ ] 2
- [ ] 3
# Question 4
Are the EPs singular?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] It depends on their use
- [x] No
# Question 5
Are the EPs unique?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] It depends on their use
- [x] No
# Question 6
What is the EP constraint condition?
- [ ] a
- [x] b
- [ ] c
# Question 7
Derive a mapping from EP to principal rotation parameters.
- [ ] a
- [ ] b
- [x] c
