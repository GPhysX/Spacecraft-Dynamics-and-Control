# Concept Check 13 - CRP Differential Kinematic Equations
## Question 1
1. In the CRP differential kinematic equations, is the [B{(\bf q)}][B(q)] matrix orthogonal?
- [ ] Yes
- [x] No
- [ ] It depends
## Question 2
2. Given {\bf q(0)} = (0.4,0.2, -0.1)q(0)=(0.4,0.2,−0.1), write a program to integrate the CRP differential kinematic equations. Assume the body angular velocity vector of the craft is given through the BB frame components as Bωω=⎡⎣sin(0.1t)0.01cos(0.1t)⎤⎦3deg/s.
Enter below the CRP norm \sqrt{q_1^2+q_2^2+q_3^2}
  at 42 seconds into the simulation.
