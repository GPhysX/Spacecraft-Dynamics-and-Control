#Concept Check 3, 4 - Devenport's q-Method
## Question 1
With Wahba’s cost function formulation, and assuming perfect measurements and no uncertainty in the satellite location and environment, the optimal attitude [\bar B N][
B
ˉ
 N] will lead to what cost function value:
- [x] a
- [ ] b
- [ ] c
## Question 2
How does Wahba’s cost function account for different sensor accuracy levels?
- [ ] a
- [x] b
- [ ] c
## Question 3
Devenport’s q-method takes the observations and creates the 4x4 [K][K] matrix. How do the optimal attitude measures relate to this matrix?
- [ ] a
- [ ] b
- [x] c
## Question 4
How does Devenport’s q-method yield 2 possible Euler parameter sets?
- [ ] a
- [x] b
- [ ] c
## Question 5
What is the biggest challenge in implementing Devenport’s q-method?
- [ ] a
- [ ] b
- [x] c
## Question 6
A spacecraft has two attitude sensors, sensing two unit vectors (directions), \hat{\bf v}_{i}
  with i=1,2i=1,2. We know the first sensor (ii=1) is more accurate than the second sensor. At an instant in time, the two vectors measured
- [ ] a
- [x] b
- [ ] c
