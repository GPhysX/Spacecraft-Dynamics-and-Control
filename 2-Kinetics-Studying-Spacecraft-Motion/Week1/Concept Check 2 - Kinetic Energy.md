# Concept Check 2 - Kinetic Energy
## Question 1
1. What is the most compact answer of \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}(5\bf v^T \bf v)
dt
- [ ] a
- [x] b
- [ ] c
## Question 2
2. A cloud contains four particles with masses m_1m
  = m_2m
  = 1 kg and m_3m
  = m_4m
  = 2 kg. The position vector of
- [x] a
- [ ] b
- [ ] c
## Question 3
Two particles with mass m/2m/2 are attached by a linear spring with a spring constant kk as shown in Fig. 1. Consider arbitrary the initial position and velocity of each mass on the plane. For simplicity, however, assume that the initial separation 2r_02r
0
​
  is the unstretched length of the spring, and that the mass center has zero inertial velocity initially. Determine the differential equations of motion whose solution would give r(t)r(t) and \theta(t)θ(t) as functions of time and initial conditions; it is not necessary to solve these differential equations.

## Question 4
Using the setup of the prior problem, determine an expression that relates the radial velocity \dot r
r
˙
  and the angular velocity \dot\theta
θ
˙
  as functions of rr, \thetaθ and initial conditions. (Hint: use conservation of energy)
