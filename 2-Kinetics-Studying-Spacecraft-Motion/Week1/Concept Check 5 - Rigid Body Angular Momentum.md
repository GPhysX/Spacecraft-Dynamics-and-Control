# Concept Check 5 - Rigid Body Angular Momentum
## Question 1
If the angular momentum of a rigid body about it’s center of mass is given by {\bf H}_c = [I_c] \pmb\omegaH
 ω, with respect to which frame are these vectors expressed?
- [ ] a
- [ ] b
- [x] c
## Question
For a rigid body, why is \dot{\bf r}
  not zero?
  - [ ] a
  - [ ] b
  - [x] c

## Question 3
If the body is rigid, with respect to what frame are the time derivatives of \bf rr going to be zero?
## Question 4
- [x] a
- [ ] b
- [ ] c
A spacecraft has an orientation expressed through (3-2-1) Euler angles as (-10, 10,5) degrees. A body angular velocity is..
- [x] a
- [ ] b
- [ ] c
